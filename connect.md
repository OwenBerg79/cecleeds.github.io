We believe that baptism is an important step on everyone's journey of following Jesus and it's something we love to celebrate as a church.

When Jesus was on earth he said that he came so that we 'may have life and life to the full' and everything he did or told us was focused around getting this fullness of life for us. So when Jesus told us to make disciples and baptise them we know that it was because it's the best thing for us.

The word 'baptise' means to immerse or dip under water, so that's what we do, just like Jesus did when he was baptised.

Choosing to be obedient to Jesus and getting baptised is part of us receiving everything he has for us. It's also a big step for any believer which is why we celebrate it as a church. If you've never been baptised or have questions about whether it could be a next step for you we'd love to chat to you. Click here to find out more.
