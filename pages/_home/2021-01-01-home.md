Whoever you are and where ever you're coming from, come and see that the Lord is good. We'd love if you <a href="/connect/">connect with us</a> and make City your home.

The world looks a little different at the moment, which means community is more important than ever, and that’s why we’d love to invite you to come and say hello. Whether you’ve never been to church before or you’re trying to find a new church, why don’t you join us? Have a look around to find out more <a href="/about/">about us</a> and <a href="/whats-on/">what's on</a>.
