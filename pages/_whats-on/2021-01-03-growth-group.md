Meeting in various homes around Beeston and North Leeds every fortnight on Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday evenings, our growth groups are a great way to meet with a small group from City to study the Bible together, pray and develop deeper relationships with each other. Please get in touch with the growth group co-ordinator if you would like to join a group.
