We know that there is immense power in prayer. As we look to build a thriving community that reaches Beeston, Holbeck and our city with the gospel, the best thing we can do is seek God and pray.

We'd love you to join us in person for our monthly prayer meetings, happening 8pm - 9pm at church on the first Wednesday of each month.
