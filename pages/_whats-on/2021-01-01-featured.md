 - Growth groups
 - Prayer meeting

We know that there is immense power in prayer. As we look to build a thriving community that reaches Beeston, Holbeck and our city with the gospel, the best thing we can do is seek God and pray. 

We'd love you to join us in person for our morning prayer meetings, happening weekly at church.
