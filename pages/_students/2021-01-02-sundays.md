# SUNDAYS

Sunday serices start at 10:45am in the church building and live online.

**Student Minibus**
Don’t let our location put you off! We run a minibus service for our students who can’t
make it to church another way. 

**Minibus pick up times:** 
* Headingley - opposite Oxfam at 10:10am.
* Leeds University - Outside the Parkinson Building at 10:15am.

## Lunches with church families
Following our Sunday morning service our students head for lunch with a family in church to enjoy some good food
and fellowship.
